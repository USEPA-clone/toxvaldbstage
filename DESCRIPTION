Version: 1.0.1
Author: Aswani Unikrishnan
Maintainer: Richard Judson <judson.richard@epa.gov>
Description: ToxValDB is a database containing quantitative records form in vivo toxicologye studies from 
  many sources (46 for this release). The database has 2 main parts - toxval_source containing 
  source data in separate tables, and the main toxval schema which combines data from multiple sources
  into a single format. Data is read from files or other databses into toxval_sources and then 
  pulled into toxval where terms are converted to standard values. The ToxValDB SOPs describe in more 
  detail how to run the code.
