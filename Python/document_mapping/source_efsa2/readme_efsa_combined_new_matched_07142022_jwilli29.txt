Matching was performed manually, first by searching Clowder/ICF/'Toxval PDFs' for the values in EFSA_combined_new$document_name and pulling the clowder_id from there. These records have a matched_from value of "clowder".

After that, I searched EFSA_combined_new.xlsx for all the document names containing "EFSA Group" that I could find in toxval_document_map_icf. If there was no record matching a given name in efsa_combined_new, I moved on. If the record in efsa_combined_new already had a Clowder ID from the previous step, I considered it matched and moved on. If it did not yet have a Clowder ID, I used the one from toxval_document_map_icf.xlsx, and if it did not have a document_name in EFSA_combined_new, I grabbed that from Clowder as well. These records have a matched_from value of "icf". 

I used the Clowder API to pull all the files it could find whose document names began with "FGE", as that seems to be the naming convention for all the files I'm trying to match. It pulled up what looks to be the same 18 that I already found and matched in the ICF/'ToxVal PDFs' space and no others. This is curious, because there are several yet-unmatched documents in the spreadsheet that have document_names, which means they should be in Clowder.

I then attempted to programmatically come up with new matches based on CAS number and author name. This proved futile, yielding no new correct matches.

Seeing no other options remaining, I went through each unmatched record by hand and searched for its author in toxval_document_Map_icf.xlsx (there did not appear to be any matches in the CCTE spreadsheet). I gave any matches a matched_from value of 'manual', although there were only a few. There were many cases where I found not the "EFSA Group x Revision y..." report on a given study, but the study itself, and these I did not count as matches but highlighted in yellow and made a note in the notes column. Those records remaining I highlighted in red, and they remain completely unmatched.

The Clowder IDs of matches were checked using the clowder_id_matcher_jwilli29.ipynb script.
